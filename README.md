# X-Touch-OSC

A bit of Software to translate the midi coming from an X-Touch Extender or X-Touch Compart to OSC commands and back.
In the config.json you define the midi notes and the osc commands who interact with eacht other.

The XTC as XTE.bin is a configfile that makes the X-Touch Compact as much as an X-Touch Extender. Using the same midi notes for the same faders. The extra encoders and buttons are extended as logical as possible.
